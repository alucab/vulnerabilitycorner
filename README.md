# Vulnerability Analysis with CISA KEV & EPSS 
A collection of vulnerability and cybersecurity data sources in easily accessible formats for lazy people. 

## What is this?â€‹

Navigating hundreds of thousands of NVD vulnerabilities can be extremely difficult and time consuming. This interactive dashboard amalgamates crucial cybersecurity insights from several powerful sources: 
- [EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats)
- [CISA KEV (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)



## How do I use this?

It's really easy, just plug and play! Click and play with the various filters and views to slice down vulnerabilities to study the relation between KEV and EPSS and perhaps understand a bit better your vulnerability posture. Have tissues close by. This dashboard has been known to bring tears of joy.

To customize it make a copy of this file, create and connect KEV and EPSS data sources from the CSV (the CSVs need some massaging) and customize dashboard to your liking. 

## Warning - Work in Progress
This dashboard is a work in progress. 
Expect more features and enhancements in the future to further augment its functionality and utility.
