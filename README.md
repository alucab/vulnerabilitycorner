# Vulnerability Analysis with CISA KEV & EPSS 
A collection of vulnerability and cybersecurity data sources in easily accessible formats for lazy people. 

## What is this?â€‹

Navigating hundreds of thousands of NVD vulnerabilities can be  difficult and time consuming. 

Several sources supply data with API, data files and so on. 
This can be sometimes inconvenient especially if you want to create quick visualizations or analyses. 

This projects aims to create interactive Google spreadsheets and Looker dashboards to amalgamate crucial cybersecurity insights without complex tools or websites.

Initial list of sources: 
- [EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats)
- [CISA KEV (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)


## How do I use this?

It's really easy, just plug and play! 

1. The spreadsheets are automatically updated, you can use them as you like
2. For the dashboards, click and play with the various filters and views to slice down vulnerabilities and to study the relation between KEV and EPSS 

Hopefully, this will help to understand a bit better your vulnerability posture. 


## Warning - Work in Progress
This project is a work in progress. 
Expect more features and enhancements in the future to further augment its functionality and utility.
